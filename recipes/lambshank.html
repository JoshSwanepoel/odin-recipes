        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Lamb shanks braised in red wine with fresh rosemary, garlic, and tomatoes. Excellent served with polenta or roasted garlic mashed potatoes, my family's favorite, to soak up the wonderful sauce. This is a fantastic dish to make for company, as all the prep work is done at the beginning. All you have to do is wait!
